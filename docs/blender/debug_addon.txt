1) using load_xxx_addon to register/unregister your addon -- remove the one register previously 

2) open blender project and setup where the root folder script is for visual code,  i.e  visual code knows where the source code is for tracking

    Setup up your Addon 

    In 3.0: Preferences > File > Script 
        select the root folder of where fly_plant is 


3) once 1/2 are done,  open load_xxx_adon.py,  run script to register (or unregister and then register)
   the new addon should be appeared in blender

4) you are able to set break point in whereever you like to stop,  even the code is in modal mode.
